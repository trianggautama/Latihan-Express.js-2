Sure they have cookies, but there are nooks and crannies in which darkness reigns so supreme, if you merely enter, you're likely to stub your toe. And even in armored boots, that's never good. Time to light up the Dark Side with these fun 3D Deco Star Wars Wall Lights."

You were right, but we didn't just want any old light source. This was definitely a 'go big, or go home' type situation. This floor lamp stands over five and a half feet tall. An elegant light source for a more civilized age."
